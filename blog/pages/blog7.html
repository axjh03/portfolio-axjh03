            Hello! I'm Alok Jha, a junior Computer Science student at The
            University of Texas at Arlington. I have a passion for computer
            vision and artificial intelligence, and I aspire to make significant
            contributions to these fields. My journey in tech has led me to
            various exciting opportunities, the most recent being my
            participation in the SoNIC program at Cornell University. Find my

          <p class="article-content">
            The SoNIC (Software-defined Networked Systems Infrastructure)
            program at Cornell University is an intensive research experience
            designed for students interested in networked systems and computer
            science. This program offers participants the chance to work closely
            with esteemed faculty and gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge
            research projects.

                My journey at Cornell University kicked off with a toasty
                welcome, reminiscent of the Texas heat. I was pretty excited, as
                it had been a whole year since I last flew out of state. <br />
                <br />
                My flight took off at the crack of dawn—7 AM—and I touched down
                in Ithaca, NY at 2:50 PM. After a mad dash through the airport,
                I raced to Phillips Hall for orientation, hoping I didn't look
                as frazzled as I felt!

            We were introduced to Dr. Bharath Hariharan, an Assistant Professor
            at Cornell University. He enlightened us about computer vision, the
            LLAVA model, and GEMINI. He also tasked us with benchmarking the
            LLMs for visual Q/A to identify the constraints of these
            cutting-edge models. That was pretty much it for the academic
            portion of the day.

            But the fun part was still ahead. In the evening, we headed to Beebe
            Lake for some canoeing. We were the first ones to get on the boat,
            and it was impressively stable—until we hit a waterfall, and our
            boat flipped. I didn't know how to swim, but thankfully, I had my
            life jacket on. As I found myself underwater, Dr. Lee Ann Roberts's
            words from orientation echoed in my mind: "A boat flipped, I don't
            know what happened to them, but they were okay... I think."
