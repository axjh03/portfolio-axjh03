                My journey at Cornell University kicked off with a toasty
                welcome, reminiscent of the Texas heat. I was pretty excited, as
                it had been a whole year since I last flew out of state. <br />
                <br />
                My flight took off at the crack of dawn—7 AM—and I touched down
                in Ithaca, NY at 2:50 PM. After a mad dash through the airport,
                I raced to Phillips Hall for orientation, hoping I didn't look
                as frazzled as I felt!

          <p class="article-subtitles">Day 2</p>
          <p class="article-content">
            We were introduced to Dr. Bharath Hariharan, an Assistant Professor
            at Cornell University. He enlightened us about computer vision, the
            LLAVA model, and GEMINI. He also tasked us with benchmarking the
            LLMs for visual Q/A to identify the constraints of these
            cutting-edge models. That was pretty much it for the academic
            portion of the day.
          </p>
          <p class="article-content">
            But the fun part was still ahead. In the evening, we headed to Beebe
            Lake for some canoeing. We were the first ones to get on the boat,
            and it was impressively stable—until we hit a waterfall, and our
            boat flipped. I didn't know how to swim, but thankfully, I had my
            life jacket on. As I found myself underwater, Dr. Lee Ann Roberts's
            words from orientation echoed in my mind: "A boat flipped, I don't
            know what happened to them, but they were okay... I think."
          </p>

          <p class="article-content">
            I was eventually rescued, but getting back into the boat proved
            impossible due to my long legs. I had to guide myself while clinging
            to a boat, making my way to shallower water. Ewww... the bacterial
            water.

          <p class="article-content">
            Day 3 was all about diving deeper into the limitations of
            state-of-the-art LLMs. We identified several key issues: text
            recognition, cluttered scenes, racial bias, counting, image quality,
            hallucination, reflections, and fine-grained classification. Our
            cohort was divided into groups to address these problems and
            fine-tune the models. My team took on the challenge of improving
            object detection.
            <br />
            <br />
            We approached this task with determination and creativity, pushing
            the boundaries of current technologies. We explored innovative
            methods and applied our skills to enhance the models' performance.
            It was intense and intellectually stimulating work, but the results
            were rewarding as we saw significant improvements.
            <br />
            <br />
            After a day of rigorous research, we headed out for some physical
            activity at the Hoffman Challenge Course. This experience was
            nothing short of amazing. The course was a series of adventurous and
            challenging obstacles that tested our teamwork and resilience. It
            was exhilarating to conquer each obstacle, and I must say, our team
            nailed it. The thrill of overcoming the challenges boosted our
            spirits and fostered a sense of camaraderie among us.

            On Day 4, we had a quieter schedule with more time spent working
            remotely. However, we had a special visit planned to the Lab of
            Ornithology located within the serene Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary.
            This sanctuary is renowned for its rich biodiversity and serves as a
            hub for bird research and conservation efforts. <br><br>During our visit, we
            had the opportunity to explore the Lab of Ornithology's facilities
            and engage in bird watching using tools like binoculars. One
            highlight was using the Merlin Bird ID app, which allowed us to
            identify various bird species based on their features and learn
            about their natural habitats and behaviors. <br><br>It was a delightful
            experience connecting with nature and witnessing firsthand the
            intersection of technology and ecological studies at such a
            prestigious location.

            <br><br>
            In the evening, we were treated to a well-deserved break with a sunset cruise on Cayuga Lake. As we sailed along, the tranquil waters provided a stunning backdrop for the setting sun.

            <br><br>
            Our team tackled an ambitious computer vision project, working through the night to prepare for our final presentation. We started by capturing images using a custom function, setting the stage for our analysis. Next, we set up advanced models like CogAgent and CogVLM, leveraging their power to detect and list objects in our images. <br><br>To enhance our results, we implemented a sophisticated image preprocessing pipeline, including denoising, sharpening, and contrast enhancement techniques. We then employed YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection system, to identify and locate objects with impressive accuracy. Our team didn't stop at static images; we extended our work to video analysis, processing frames and annotating detected objects in real-time. <br><br>Throughout the project, we utilized Agile methodology, allowing us to adapt quickly to challenges and iterate on our solutions. We integrated various technologies, from basic image processing to advanced AI models, showcasing our versatility and technical prowess. In the end, our hard work paid off as we emerged victorious in the final presentation. This experience not only demonstrated our technical skills but also highlighted the power of teamwork and perseverance in tackling complex AI challenges
